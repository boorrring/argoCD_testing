What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

Think of it like apt for Linux or npm for JavaScript, but specifically for Kubernetes. It helps you install, configure, and manage applications in Kubernetes clusters easily.

Why Use Helm?

When you run apps in Kubernetes, you often need to manage a lot of complex configurations. Things like:

Which Docker images to use

What environment variables the app needs

How many replicas (copies) of the app you need

Which services to expose

Without Helm, you’d have to manually write a bunch of YAML files to set all that up, which can be a lot of work and can get messy fast.

What Helm Does:

Packages Apps: Helm allows you to package applications into Helm charts. A chart is like a "blueprint" that defines all the Kubernetes resources (like Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) required to run an app.

Installs Apps: With Helm, you can install a packaged chart into your Kubernetes cluster with just a single command. Helm will automatically create all the necessary resources for you.

Manages and Updates: Helm makes it easy to update, roll back, or uninstall apps, so you don’t need to manually deal with YAML files every time you make changes.
